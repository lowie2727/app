## An app for tracking spaceflights using the [Launch Library 2 API](https://thespacedevs.com/llapi)

## Minimum requirements

Every App should at minimum contain the following:

* [ ] At least three fragments _or_ activities;
* [x] At least one data storage/request system;
* [ ] At least one master/detail using a `RecyclerView`;
* [x] At least one `Intent`;
* [ ] At least one menu option;
* [ ] At least one data signal to be used (GPS, Camera, accelerometer, ...);
* [ ] At least one extra feature you can freely choose. For instance:
    - Authentication through Google's Play Store or [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/?pli=1)
    - Sharing data between apps using a `ContentProvider`
    - Etc... See [links](https://kuleuven-diepenbeek.github.io/appdev-course/extra/links) for more inspiration on what's possible.

## TODO
* API call should automatically save rocket launches instead of pressing a button (execute function when api responds)
* adding functionality to the navigation drawer
* check for null values in json response
* making a new activity/fragment for a more detailed view of the launch
